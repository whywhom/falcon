                            | WAY BETTER THAN THE REST - Our bag is more comfortable than the competition due to more padding and cushioning inside to make sure you are well rested and fully re-energized.
                        p
                            | BEST YEAR ROUND SLEEPING BAG - Perfect for spring, summer, fall, and winter weather, everything above 32°F freezing temperatures. Keep yourself cosy, warm and safe in every situation. The ultra-strong, waterproof outer protective shell is made from our unique waterproof ripstop hexagonal weave, double-layered with S-shape stitching, and 3D inner synthetic fiber fill for optimal warmth and insulation to protect you from the elements.
                        p
                            | CAMP IN COMFORT FOR ALL AGES - Bring the comfort of your own bed to the great outdoors. Our camping sleeping bags are engineered to guarantee a good night's sleep after a hard day of activities. No matter how tough the terrain or long the day, sleep well with MalloMe. Great for kids too!
                        p
                            | ULTRALIGHT FOR BACKPACKING - A must have for hiking, backpacking, and camping, the perfect balance of performance and lightweight materials for every adventure. Each sleeping bag comes with a compression sack with straps, which makes it super convenient to store and easy to carry.
                        p
                            | EASY TO CLEAN - Our waterproof outer shell is easily wiped clean with a damp cloth. In case of heavy soilage the sleeping bag is designed for machine washing as well, ensuring easy maintenance and longevity.
                        p
                            | EXCELLENT DESIGN - Enjoy high-quality double-sided zippers that are snag-free and super satisfying to use. Tug those drawstrings in the headrest to bring the bag a little closer to your head for extra warmth in colder weather. While you’re there, pat that extra velcro securing strap too - it’ll keep you nice and snug with no unwanted zipper movement.
